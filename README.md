# Python Practice Questions & Answers

- Constructor in Python
  
  Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.

- Inheritance in Python
  
  Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
  Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
  Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

- Object in python

  An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:


Example:  Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
```py 
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```
- Class in python				

  A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
  
  To create a class, use the keyword class:
  
Example: Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
```py
class MyClass:
x = 5  X = 5
```
